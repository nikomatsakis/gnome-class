* TODO include a floating ref guard:

<slomo> federico_: ok :) basically, you need something like this
everywhere: https://github.com/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs/blob/dda3b5ff1a6d99d5f55d15465c4ab8b145f0b817/gst-plugin/src/base_sink.rs#L517
. it's defined here https://github.com/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs/blob/dda3b5ff1a6d99d5f55d15465c4ab8b145f0b817/gst-plugin/src/lib.rs#L32-L58

<slomo> federico_: otherwise you get a floating reference somewhere in
your vfuncs or elsewhere, and treat them as (transfer none). which
then ref_sinks it, stealing the reference from somewhere else

* TODO Support subclassing from anything other than GObject

** Grammar supports "class Foo extends Bar"

** Need to support "class Foo: ParentClass, Iface1, Iface2" instead

* TODO Virtual + non-virtual methods?

Virtual ones have a slot in FooClass; non-virtual ones don't.

* TODO In class structures, reserve slots for API expansions without ABI breaks

#[repr(C)]
pub struct GtkBoxClass {
    pub parent_class: GtkContainerClass,
    pub _gtk_reserved1: Option<unsafe extern "C" fn()>,
    pub _gtk_reserved2: Option<unsafe extern "C" fn()>,
    pub _gtk_reserved3: Option<unsafe extern "C" fn()>,
    pub _gtk_reserved4: Option<unsafe extern "C" fn()>,
}

Maybe have something like

gobject_gen! {
    class Foo: glib::Object {
        struct FooPrivate {
            ....
        }

        signal ...;
        fn ...;

        reserve_slots(N);       // <------ this; to be decremented when needed
    }
}




* Reordering class fields is an ABI break.  Shoule we warn about this / how?

* Conversation with acrichto about proc-macros-2

<federico> acrichto: ping
<acrichto> federico: pong
<federico> acrichto: hey there!
<acrichto> :D
<federico> acrichto: I want to move gnome-class to proc-macros-2
<acrichto> nice!
<federico> I'm rather tired of not getting meaningful error messages :)
<acrichto> federico: I'd love to help out! I've had lots of fun with proc macros lately
<acrichto> do you want a rundown of how proc-macro2 works?
<federico> acrichto: do you have any pointers?  I don't even know if gnome-class's scheme of "tokens to string, lalrpop on that, generated code to tokens" was widely used before
<federico> acrichto: yes, that would be very helpful.  I haven't looked closely for docs yet
<acrichto> ok sure yeah
<acrichto> so just to make sure I understand, you're using macro_rules! right now, right?
<acrichto> or procedural macros?
<acrichto> or rather, you're doing something like -- gnome_class! { ... }
<acrichto> right?
<federico> #[proc_macro]
<acrichto> ok excellent
<federico> it starts here:
<federico> https://github.com/federicomenaquintero/gnome-class/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L150
<federico> and the code generator is here:
<federico> https://github.com/federicomenaquintero/gnome-class/blob/master/src/gen/mod.rs
<federico> lalrpop and our own ast:
<acrichto> heh ok
<acrichto> so this isn't gonna be an easy transition
<federico> https://github.com/federicomenaquintero/gnome-class/blob/master/src/parser/grammar.lalrpop
<federico> https://github.com/federicomenaquintero/gnome-class/blob/master/src/ast.rs
<acrichto> so lemme give you some background on proc-macro2 and such
<federico> sure
<acrichto> so right now the only *stable* thing is #[proc_macro_derive]
<acrichto> which given a TokenStream calls .to_string() and returns another parsed tokenstream
<acrichto> as you've found out, this trashes all span information and makes errors awful
<acrichto> so the next step is to preserve span information of all the tokens in the stream itself
<acrichto> TokenStream is, after all, a stream of tokens!
<acrichto> so right now this is all unstable upstream
<acrichto> but hopefully not for too too long!
<acrichto> so proc-macro2 is sort of a bolt-on on top of this
<acrichto> where the idea of proc-macro2 was to cater to both stable and unstable users
<acrichto> where the crate itself provides a copy of the `proc_macro` (upstream rustc crate) api
<acrichto> and then you can tell proc_macro2 to implement itself either in terms of a stable string-based implementation or an unstable token-based implementation
<acrichto> so in general, proc_macro2 is solving the serde use case of it works on stable, but on nightly you can get excellent span information
<acrichto> another intention of it was to ease the transition from string-based procedural mcaros to token-based ones
<acrichto> in that you could write a token-based one *today*, comiple on stable, and then eventually you'll just magically get better errors
<acrichto> b/c we can switch the implementation of proc_macro2 by default
<acrichto> but anyway, the tl;dr; is that proc_macro2 may not be precisely what you want to use (if you're tied to nightly for other reasons)
<acrichto> but it is probably a good spot to start!
<acrichto> https://docs.rs/proc-macro2/0.1.3/proc_macro2/
<acrichto> the api docs there are basically teh same as the upstream proc_macro crate itself
<acrichto> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libproc_macro/lib.rs
<acrichto> we still need to host comipler docs :(
<acrichto> make sense so far?
<federico> yeah, makes sense
<federico> maybe I have the wrong mental model, but:
<federico> 1. if I get a TokenStream (and I can indeed use the tokens I get, given that our mini-language is a superset of rust), I can probably remove gnome-class/src/tok
<federico> 2. I wouldn't know if using lalrpop with tokens from the TokenStream makes sense
<federico> 3. (... I'd prefer not to parse the TokenStream by hand...)
<acrichto> (1) is correct yeah, you wouldn't need to define your own tokens, you'd just use tokens from proc_macro (or proc_macro2, they're the same)
<acrichto> (2) is also probably a "no" to lalrpop in that it most likely is intended mainly for usage with strings, not token streams (although I could be wrong!)
<federico> 4. AFAICT our ast.rs is fine as it is; maybe the proc-macro stuff already has nice representations for types, return values, arguments, etc.
<acrichto> and with (3), that's where I can help :)
<acrichto> lemme get some links
<acrichto> ok so this the exact same problem for another project
<acrichto> syn -- https://github.com/dtolnay/syn
<acrichto> where that's basically a rust parser
<acrichto> but intended for procedural macros
<acrichto> so historically it's operated with strings, but now all of a sudden it needed to work with tokens isntead
<federico> lalrpop lets you have your own tokenizer, and it has its own concept of spans; not sure if it's compatible with proc-macros's model
<acrichto> so we rewrote it!
<acrichto> yeah niko I think would have to comment about lalrpop
<acrichto> in whether that'd be compatible
<acrichto> I'm sure he'd like it to be at the very least :)
<acrichto> but an alternate strategy, at least, would require two things
<acrichto> oh so also before I go further
<acrichto> one fundamental ability you'll need to add is to *go back* to a TokenStream
<acrichto> that is, you'll take a TokenStream, parse it, munge it, create a new AST, and then convert that back to a TokenStream
<acrichto> and then that'll later get parsed as valid rust
<acrichto> but ok, so what you'll probably want to do here is to at least start out exploring a few projects
<acrichto> first up there's syn, the rust syntax parser
<acrichto> (the master branch, not published on crates.io)
<acrichto> this branches uses a variant of the `nom` parsing framework, basically a recursive descent parser
<acrichto> here's how it parses for loops, for example -- https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/blob/master/src/expr.rs#L1419-L1438
<acrichto> the idea is that you'd define this `Synom` trait for all your AST constructs
<acrichto> and then it's relatively simple composition to build up a composite parser
<acrichto> not exactly the fastest parser in the world, but it was easy enough to use I found personaly
<acrichto> again though, if you want to stick with lalrpop, it may still be possible
<acrichto> to auto-generate these parsers for you
<acrichto> I'm just not 100% sure how the spans and such would work
<acrichto> but that should at least get you to a parsed AST
<acrichto> and you'll need to modify your AST as well to contain span information in it (but sounds like you already do?)
<acrichto> once you've got all that working the `quote` crate comes into play
<acrichto> https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/
<acrichto> where that crate is intended to basically assist in creating a TokenStream
<acrichto> for example, this is how a forloop is tokenized -- https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/blob/master/src/expr.rs#L2489-L2502
<acrichto> that has it all baked in how to create tokens with spans and whatnot
<acrichto> so you could implement ToTokens for all your AST types
<acrichto> and compose them together and whatnot
<acrichto> oh lol you're already using `quote`
<acrichto> in that case you'd just upgrade the dep
<acrichto> and then it'll whine *a lot* about "you need to pass a span here"
<acrichto> and you'll basically just start threading spans through the AST after that
<acrichto> so that was a quite a bit
<acrichto> any of that doesn't make sense though?
<federico> no, it makes perfect sense
<federico> I'm a bit scared of nom - had a very bad time with it in librsvg, but this is higher level than what I was doing there
<acrichto> yeah I haven't used nom much historically
<federico> do you have an example that already uses quote?
<acrichto> and I wouldn't call the syn parsers easy to read/write
<acrichto> you can use quote! in general like -- https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await/blob/master/futures-async-macro/src/lib.rs#L172-L177
<acrichto> to just create arbitrary instances of TokenStream
<federico> we basically quote a lot of boilerplate, and insert stringified symbol names, and then just paste big blobs of the user's method implementations in the middle
<acrichto> yeah definitely
<acrichto> so actually, you may want to explore this crate too -- https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await/blob/master/futures-async-macro/src/lib.rs
<acrichto> that's the implementation of #[async] right now
<acrichto> and so one thing you'll have to deal with
<acrichto> is in general you get tokens from a user
<acrichto> but you'll manufacture your own as well
<acrichto> the stuff you manufacture tends to be boilerplate/wrappers
<acrichto> but often error spans will still go to those locations
<acrichto> on the tokens you manufacture
<acrichto> futures-await does a bit of hackery to ensure that things are spanned right
<acrichto> basically taking existing spans and applying them to generated tokens
<acrichto> for example the `respan` function there
<acrichto> note, again, though, that this isn't very pretty
<acrichto> working with syn/proc-macro2 isn't exactly the most ergonomic thing in the world right now
<acrichto> but it gets you nice errors at lesat!
<acrichto> and we're of course always looking for what idioms to move to standard libraries and such
<federico> yeah, I'm looking at respan() and replace_bang()
<acrichto> oh so one important thing, quote! -the-macro will insert "bad spans"
<acrichto> basically the default one
<federico> hmm, is replace_bang() conceptually different from quote! { blah blah #thing blah }?
<acrichto> yeah
<acrichto> specifically w/ spans
<acrichto> it allowed me to do --
<acrichto> let a = quote! { a ! b };
<acrichto> let a = change_all_span(a);
<acrichto> let a = replace_bang(a, what_i_wanted_to_quote_but_not_chang_spans);
<acrichto> I couldn't think of another way to "change all tokens with the default span but leave actual spans alone"
<federico> I should look at what's in a Span - but does this let me know the difference between "error in the boilerplate" and "error in the user's code"?
<acrichto> oh right now a Span is entirely opaque
<acrichto> it's just a Copy/Clone thing
<acrichto> w/ no accessors
<federico> about tokenization:
<federico> acrichto: https://gist.github.com/federicomenaquintero/4f55c251d50787bee2d60b5e26e5fc93
<federico> we have stuff like "class Foo", "private_init()", "signal bar(&self)", "virtual fn blah()"
<federico> class, private_init, signal, virtual - those are more or less reserved words in our mini-language
<acrichto> sure yeah
<federico> would they get tokenized as identifiers, or do I need to declare them somehow?
<acrichto> nah yeah they're all just a Term
<acrichto> https://docs.rs/proc-macro2/0.1.3/proc_macro2/enum.TokenNode.html
<acrichto> every single token is one of those 4
<acrichto> so all word-like things are a Term
<acrichto> rust keyword or not
<federico> oh, perfect

<federico> acrichto: so, the code generator already spits a quote::Tokens
<acrichto> nice!
<federico> we then stringify that, rustfmt the string, and then TokenStream::from_str(rustfmted_string) - and that's what our #[proc_macro] returns
<acrichto> yeah w/ proc-macro2 you'd just all .into
<acrichto> quote::Tokens -> TokenStream directly
<federico> cool, then I think I'll start there
<federico> I should then be able to specify whatever compile-time flag or feature or whatever to be able to look at the generated code, right?
<federico> (right now I println!() the rustfmt_string and eyeball that...)

<federico> nmatsakis: I haven't read the lalrpop docs about spans carefully... is it compatible with the scheme in proc-macros-2?
<nmatsakis> presumably
<nmatsakis> I'm not sure... oh there are *some* docs here
<nmatsakis> https://github.com/nikomatsakis/lalrpop/blob/master/doc/lexer_tutorial.md
<nmatsakis> but basically lalrpop lets you define a custom tokenizer
<nmatsakis> in which you can specify any type you want as your tokens
<nmatsakis> if you like, you can include locations
<nmatsakis> in which case your tokenizer needs to yield up tuples like (L1, T, L2)
<nmatsakis> where L1 and L2 are the "start" and "end" locations for the token T
<nmatsakis> (your tokenizer itself is just something that gives an Iterator)
<nmatsakis> so essentially it should be compatible with just about *any* scheme,
<nmatsakis> so long as 'locations' have a type

* Notes on syn

** Augmenting the language

It feels like, out of the box, proc_macro2 and syn provide machinery
to implement your own attributes or derive-like things.

However, gnome-class more or less wants to augment the language.

I had to write src/parser/mod.rs keyword() by basically copying a bit
from syn/synom/src/tokens.rs.  Could there be a built-in way to do
this instead?

    impl Synom for my_ast::Foo {
        named!(parse -> Self, do_parse!(
            call!(keyword("foo")) >>
            other_stuff: ...      >>
            (my_ast::Foo { ... other_stuff ... })
        ));
    }

** Tests for just your parser

It's not obvious how to write your parser bit by bit, with tests along
the way.  In particular, how to get a valid TokenStream so you can run
syn on it, without having the whole proc_macro2 machinery in place.

    fn parses_class_name() {
        let raw = "class Foo {}";

        let token_stream = raw.parse::<TokenStream>().unwrap();

        // We can't use
        //
        //   let class: ast::Class = syn::parse(token_stream).unwrap().1;
        //
        // because syn::parse() takes a proc_macro::TokenStream, not a
        // proc_macro2::TokenStream.
        //
        // So, we'll do the conversion to a Cursor by hand.

        let buffer = SynomBuffer::new(token_stream);
        let cursor = buffer.begin();
        let class: ast::Class = ast::Class::parse(cursor).unwrap().1;
        assert_eq!(class.name.as_ref(), "Foo");
    }

** Error messages

I couldn't find a way to create a meaningful ParseError.  The exported
parse_error() doesn't let one provide a string or anything.

* Vala mixins

Vala allows interfaces to have non-virtual method implementations,
much like Rust's traits with default methods.  Look at the generated C
code!

public interface HelloMixin {
    public virtual void say_hello () {
        print ("Hello, world!");
    }
}

public interface ByeMixin {
    public void say_bye () {
        print ("Bye, world!");
    }
}

public class Foo : Object, HelloMixin, ByeMixin {
    public Foo () {
        this.say_hello ();
    }

    ~Foo () {
        this.say_bye ();
    }

    void say_hello () {
        print ("Hello specific to Foo");
    }
/*
    void hello_there (string s) {
        print ("hello, %s", s);
    }
    */
}

void main () {
    new Foo ();
}
